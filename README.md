# Loop Android Sample - Setting up test users

These instructions will get you a copy of a Loop sample app up and running for sending signals.

1. If you havenâ€™t already, signup for a loop account (it takes seconds - https://developer.dev.loop.ms/) 
2. Create an app to get your loop app key and secret token
3. Clone this sample app (`git clone https://github.com/Microsoft/Loop-Sample-Hello-Android.git`), and open it in Android Studio. Replace the `your_app_id` and `your_app_token` constant in `LoopHelloApplication.java` with your loop app key and secret token. 
4. Run the app. 

After this is done, you can send test signals to Loop and see them in your dashboard.
